Passionate entrepreneur about technology, with more than 10 years of experience in the field of professional rugby.
I speak 3 languages and enjoy creating strong relationships with people. I have studied and worked as a personal trainer, and my interest in current affairs and new technologies has led me to explore the world of programming, Data Science and Machine Learning.
I am looking for a challenging position where I can combine my skills and experience to contribute to the success of an innovative company.
